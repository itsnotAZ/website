# Age of History II: The Rise of INGSOC (1984 mod)

![1984B](img/aoh1984thumbbig.png)

## Description

*War is Peace*<br>
*Freedom is Slavery*<br>
*Ignorance is Strength*<br>

This is a mod I made for Age of History II shortly before Age of History III came out, but I am releasing it here because I want the world to see it since it is an attempt to make a political representation and alternate history on how 1984 came to be and how it will progress beyond the book.

This mod is based on the "Nineteen Eighty Four" novel by George Orwell. 
It is still in alpha and I don't really know if I will still keep working on it and I will not port it to Age of History III, but that is all subject to change.
The mod has a new scenario ("Perpetual War") and modifies the WWII scenario to portray how INGSOC and the other superstates came to be (INCOMPLETE).

Instructions on installation can be found [here (see table of contents)](about.md).
